# MINT (mintframework)

MINT is a model inference tool. PRINS internally uses MINT to infer component-level models.

We just converted the original source code into an executable jar file, i.e., `mint-inference.jar`; we did not modify the source code.

For more information, please visit the Github page for MINT: https://github.com/neilwalkinshaw/mintframework or the archived page https://github.com/donghwan-shin/mintframework.
